# A simple graphical user interface for Compart mcopy (cpmcopy)
This is just a test application but helps not having to remember cpmcopy command lines and use a UI instead.

Just start the jar contained in the /dist folder by double clicking in Windows explorer or use "java -jar Rfi2.jar" to start the application.

Implemented with Apache netbeans.
